ALINSKY TO DO LIST

Queers in closer to proper proportions.

Finish populating names for ethnicities!
Add asian ethnicities besides indonesian

reduce indent on unordered lists?  Only in Map pane?

Now makes gay bars

Typical Clients and findClient()
	Network in Church: create weak coupling of ethnicity and faith so Jews tend to be Jews






Need to split Person() constructor into two bits:
	a) setting up the basic demographics, which can be edited by newClient() and newEmployee()
	b) then doing backstory, naming, issues, etc

Fix findJob() to take institution argument but not level argument.
	remove openings based on TypicalEmployees criteria

Fix findHousing() to take money into account
	Add roommates to findHousing()

Fix findChurch() to seek out a church with similar people

Rework the Neighborhood() init so that it produces random shares of ethnicities, not races.  Then rework the view.displayNeighborhood to figure ethnicity demographics, then figure race demographics, then display that.
	Then fix Institution() so that its typical clientele pulls from its neighborhood picklist.

Typical Employees and findEmployee()
	Gender, marriage, and orientation requirements for employment
		- clergy for an institutionalized explicit example
		- everywhere else for the reality of things
	
Flesh out institution names

Family connections
