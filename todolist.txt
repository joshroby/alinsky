ALINSKY TO DO LIST

Fix findHousing() to take money into account
	Add roommates to findHousing()



Need to split Person() constructor into two bits:
	a) setting up the basic demographics, which can be edited by newClient() and newEmployee()
	b) then doing backstory, naming, issues, etc

Fix findJob() to take institution argument but not level argument.
	remove openings based on TypicalEmployees criteria (missed criteria increase number)


Fix findChurch() to seek out a church with similar people

Fix displayContact() to handle any combination of ethnicities

Update the OldTimeReligion and LiberalReligion lists

Community() pickLists are getting defined with one too few items (sometimes?)

Personal Network kids should only be grown adult kids.

Rework the Neighborhood() init so that it produces random shares of ethnicities, not races.  Then rework the view.displayNeighborhood to figure ethnicity demographics, then figure race demographics, then display that.
	Then fix Institution() so that its typical clientele pulls from its neighborhood picklist.

Typical Employees and findEmployee()
